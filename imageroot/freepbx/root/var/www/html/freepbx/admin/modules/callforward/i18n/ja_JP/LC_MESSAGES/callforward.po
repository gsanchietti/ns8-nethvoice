# CREDITS for JAPANESE TRANSLATION
# ================================
# Current translation & maintenance: QLOOG, Inc. (Kobe, Japan)
# Inquiries: info@qloog.com / www.qloog.com
#
# This translation is a culmination of the hard work of
# several outstanding individuals, which started in 2009 with the 
# first-ever Japanese localization of FreePBX by Kenichi Fukaumi 
# and Kazuhiro Tokuyama (FreePBX Japanized Project).
#
# Beginning in 2013, with the approval of the original authors, 
# QLOOG undertook a large scale overhaul of the translation to 
# expand it for compatibility with FreePBX 2.11. Our work is, 
# of course, released under the same GPLv2 license as FreePBX. 
# We only ask that you kindly retain these credits in honor of 
# the time and effort that all of us have contributed. Enjoy!
